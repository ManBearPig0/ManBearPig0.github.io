	<!-- General intro. -->
	Laravel is an easy to use, hard to master framework based on PHP. This framework can serve as a tutorial for learning proper website coding structures and all the features that come with it.
	
	<!-- But what is a framework and how does it work? -->
	Frameworks provide software developers a foundation to build their programs on. 
	This can be predefined classes and functions, managing hardware devices and interacting with system software.
	Laravel is an example of a framework that provides a foundation ontop of PHP with a predefined structure, classes en functions to make coding websites a lot quicker, 
	less error prone, safer and with more functionalities. 

	<!-- Laravels framework -->
	Laravel is still growing and one of the best choices for full-stack development using PHP. 
	For if you are starting out or are experienced in web development, laravel is a progressive framework: meaning it grows with you.

	Laravel has a ton of useful features, but you only need to know about 1/8th or less of it to start creating modern professional websites.
	With laravels help, while developing, you will eventually learn of the capabilities of websites. Any addition you would want, laravel almost certainly has something that could help you,
	with easy to follow tutorials to guide you. With neatly structured directories, laravel has a separate, easy to find, place for each feature. 

	<!-- Laravel's MVC architecture -->
	Laravel's provides a standard MVC software architecture, which stands for Model-View-Controller. 
	This architecture separates the application logic and rest of the user interface into three parts: the model, the view and the controller.

	The model is a representation of a real-life instance or object that holds or retrieves the data from a certain database table. 
	
	The controller is the bridge between the model and view. It should handle logic to request data from a model to be send to a view 
	and converts user action into different actions like routing or saving data in the a table via a model. The controller is also used for validating and sanitizing user posts.

	The view is essentially the front-end side. It builds the user interface, possibly with extra data retrieved from the back-end controller. 
	Here you will render data into user-friendly html webpages.
