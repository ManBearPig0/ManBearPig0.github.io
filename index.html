        <!-- Laravel's MVC architecture -->
        <article>
            <h2>Model View Controller</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-8">
                    <p>
                        <span class="text-laravel">Laravel's</span> provides a standard MVC software architecture, which stands for Model-View-Controller. This architecture separates the application logic and rest of the user interface into three parts:
                        the model, the view and the controller. The model is a representation of a real-life instance or object that holds or retrieves the data from a certain database table. The controller is the bridge between the model and view. It
                        should handle logic to request data from a model to be send to a view and converts user action into different actions like routing or saving data in the a table via a model. The controller is also used for validating and sanitizing
                        user posts. The view is essentially the front-end side. It builds the user interface, possibly with extra data retrieved from the back-end controller. Here you will render data into user-friendly html webpages.
