            Frameworks provide software developers a foundation to build their programs on. This can be predefined classes and functions, managing hardware devices and interacting with system software. <span class="text-laravel">Laravel</span> is an example

        <!-- Laravel's MVC architecture -->
        <p>
            <span class="text-laravel">Laravel's</span> provides a standard MVC software architecture, which stands for Model-View-Controller. This architecture separates the application logic and rest of the user interface into three parts: the model,
            the view and the controller. The model is a representation of a real-life instance or object that holds or retrieves the data from a certain database table. The controller is the bridge between the model and view. It should handle logic to
            request data from a model to be send to a view and converts user action into different actions like routing or saving data in the a table via a model. The controller is also used for validating and sanitizing user posts. The view is essentially
            the front-end side. It builds the user interface, possibly with extra data retrieved from the back-end controller. Here you will render data into user-friendly html webpages.
        </p>
